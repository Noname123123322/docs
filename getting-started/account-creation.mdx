## Overview

To get the most out of Core Host, you'll need two separate accounts — one for billing and one for managing your game server.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card icon="credit-card" iconType="solid" href="https://billings.corehost.store" title="Billing Portal">
    Manage purchases, subscriptions, invoices, and support tickets.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="server" iconType="solid" href="https://panel.corehost.store" title="Game Panel">
    Start/stop servers, edit files, add sub-users, and monitor performance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  These are **two separate accounts** with separate logins. You must register on both platforms individually.
</Warning>

## Billing Account

The billing account is your first step — it's required to purchase any server plan and access support.

### Step 1 — Visit the Billing Portal

Head to the Core Host billing panel and click **Register** to begin.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your personal details">
    Complete all required fields in the registration form:

    - **Full Name** — Your first and last name
    - **Email Address** — A valid, accessible email
    - **Phone Number** — Used for account verification
    - **Address** — Required for billing purposes
    - **Password** — Choose a strong, unique password
    - **Confirm Password** — Re-enter your password to confirm

    <Note>
      Your Discord ID is optional, but recommended if you'd like faster support through our Discord server.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the Terms of Service">
    Read and accept the Core Host Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before proceeding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit your registration">
    Click **Sign Up** to create your account. You'll receive a verification email shortly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use a password with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Consider a password manager to keep your credentials secure.
</Tip>

### Step 3 — Verify Your Email

Email verification is required to activate your account and unlock full access.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your inbox">
    Look for an email from **Core Host** with the subject line _"Please verify your email address"_. It typically arrives within 1–2 minutes.

        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/29935-1.png"
        alt="Verification email (dark mode)"
      />
      <img
        className="dark:hidden"
        src="/images/29935.png"
        alt="Verification email (light mode)"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the email">
    Inside, you'll find a verification button or link to activate your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the verification link">
    Clicking the link confirms your email and unlocks full access to the billing portal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Haven't received the email after 5 minutes? Check your **Spam or Junk** folder, or request a new verification email from the login page.
</Note>

---

### Step 4 — Log In

Once verified, visit the billing portal and sign in with your credentials. You're now ready to purchase a server, manage your subscription, and submit support tickets.

<Check>
  Your billing account is active and ready to use.

## Game Panel Account

The game panel — powered by [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io) — is where you'll manage your server's technical settings, files, and configurations.

<Info>
  Game panel accounts are **created automatically** when you purchase a server. You cannot manually register before making a purchase.
</Info>

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase a server plan">
    Order a game server through the billing portal. Your game panel account will be provisioned automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive your credentials">
    After purchase, you'll receive an email containing:

    - Your game panel login URL
    - Your username (typically your email)
    - Instructions to set your password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your game panel">
    Follow the instructions in the email to log in and start managing your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If this is your first time purchasing from Core Host, complete the billing account setup above **before** placing an order.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do I need two separate accounts?">
    The billing account handles payments and subscriptions, while the game panel account gives you technical control over your servers. Separating these systems improves security and allows for better access management — for example, you can add sub-users to your game panel without giving them billing access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I didn't receive the verification email. What should I do?">
    First, check your **Spam or Junk** folder. If it's not there, wait 5 minutes and request a new verification email from the billing panel login page. Still having issues? [Contact our support team](/support).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I create a game panel account before purchasing?">
    No — game panel accounts are generated automatically when you purchase a server. This ensures your panel access is properly linked to your active services.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I forgot my password. How do I reset it?">
    Click the **Forgot Password** link on either the billing panel or game panel login page. You'll receive a password reset email with further instructions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same password for both accounts?">
    While technically possible, we strongly recommend using **different passwords** for each platform. A password manager makes this easy to maintain without having to remember multiple credentials.
  </Accordion>
