The **Console** (or Terminal) is the command center for your server. It allows you to monitor your server's activity in real-time, execute commands directly to the server instance, and manage power states.

## Power Controls

Located at the top right of the terminal window, these buttons control the power state of your server.

| Button | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start** | `Boot` | Starts the server process. If the server is already running, this button is disabled. |
| **Restart** | `Reboot` | Safely stops the server and immediately starts it again. Recommended for applying config changes. |
| **Stop** | `Kill` | Stops the server process. Use the "Kill" option only if the server is unresponsive. |

<Warning>
  **Forcing a Stop:** Clicking the "Stop" button multiple times may force-kill the process. This can result in data corruption if plugins or worlds are not saved properly. Always try to let the server stop gracefully first.
</Warning>

## Terminal Output

The large black area displays the live log output from your server console.

* **Live Monitoring:** View startup logs, player chat, error messages, and plugin activity as they happen.
* **History:** You can scroll up to view previous log entries since the panel was opened.

<Tip>
  **Auto Optimised Egg:** As seen in the banner, Core Hosting offers an auto-optimised egg. If you see performance warnings in your console, consider switching to our optimised egg to apply recommended tweaks automatically.
</Tip>

## Sending Commands

Below the terminal output is the command input field.

1.  Click into the text box that says **"Type a command..."**.
2.  Type your command (e.g., `op <username>`, `gamemode creative`, `whitelist add`).
3.  Press **Enter** to send it.

<Note>
  You do not need to type `/` before commands in the console (unlike in-game).
</Note>

## Server Statistics

The sidebar on the right provides real-time resource usage data for your specific instance.

* **Address:** Your server's connection IP and port (e.g., `sg.corehost.store:20094`).
* **Uptime:** How long the server has been running since the last start.
* **CPU Load:** Current CPU usage relative to your plan's limit.
* **Memory:** RAM usage. If this hits your limit (e.g., 8 GiB), the server may crash (OOM Kill).
* **Disk:** Storage space used by your server files.
* **Network:** Real-time incoming and outgoing traffic.

### Performance Graphs

At the bottom of the page, you will find visual graphs for **CPU Load**, **Memory**, and **Network**. These are useful for identifying usage spikes or diagnosing lag during specific times.
