## Overview

The **Console** (also called the Terminal) is the heart of your game panel. It gives you a live, real-time view of everything happening on your server — from player activity and logs to performance metrics. You can send commands, control server power, and diagnose issues all from one place.

  ![Power control buttons — Start, Restart, Stop](/images/31197.png)
</Frame>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card icon="circle-play" iconType="solid" title="Start (Green)">
    Boots up your server. Use this when your server is offline and you want to bring it online.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="rotate" iconType="solid" title="Restart (Yellow)">
    Gracefully restarts your server. Useful after making configuration changes or installing plugins/mods.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="circle-stop" iconType="solid" title="Stop (Red)">
    Safely shuts down your server. Always prefer this over killing the process to avoid data corruption.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  Avoid closing your browser or cutting power while the server is starting up or shutting down. Always wait for the process to complete fully.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  After installing a new plugin, mod, or making changes to a config file, use **Restart** rather than Stop + Start — it's faster and safer.

## Live Console & Logs

The large scrolling area in the center of the page is your **live console log**. Every server event is streamed here in real time — player joins, disconnections, errors, plugin messages, and more.

### Reading the Logs

Each log line follows a structured format:

```
[HH:MM:SS] [Thread/Level]: Message
```

Here are the four log levels you'll encounter:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="circle-info" iconType="solid" title="INFO — General Information">
    Routine server activity. Players joining or leaving, world loading, plugin messages, and other standard events. No action needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid" title="WARN — Warning">
    A non-critical issue the server has flagged. It's still running, but something may need your attention — such as a misconfigured plugin or a deprecated setting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="circle-xmark" iconType="solid" title="ERROR — Error">
    Something went wrong. The server may continue running, but a feature or plugin may have failed. Read the message carefully and investigate the cause.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="skull" iconType="solid" title="FATAL — Critical Failure">
    A severe error that typically causes the server to crash or shut down automatically. If you see this, check the full log and contact support if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  If your server crashes or behaves unexpectedly, the console log is the first place to look. Copy the relevant error lines and share them with our support team for faster diagnosis.
</Tip>

### Common Log Examples

Here's what typical console output looks like in action:

```log
[15:00:22 INFO]: HUMBLЕССС gave 1 [Totem of Undying] to HUMBLЕСССС
[15:05:38 INFO]: HUMBLЕССС lost connection: Disconnected
[16:46:38 INFO]: F_Ahejilo joined the game
[16:49:02 INFO]: F_Ahejilo lost connection: Disconnected
```

<Note>
  The console log does **not** persist between sessions. If you need to retain logs long-term, consider setting up a logging plugin on your server (e.g. CoreProtect for Minecraft).
</Note>

---

## Sending Commands

The command input bar is located at the **bottom of the console**, below the log output. This is where you type and send commands directly to your server.

### How to Send a Command

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the command input bar">
    Click on the text field at the bottom of the console that says **"Type a command..."**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type your command">
    Enter your command. For Minecraft, commands do **not** need a leading `/` when sent from the console — the server interprets them directly.

    ```bash
        say Hello everyone, the server is restarting in 5 minutes!
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Press Enter to send">
    Hit **Enter** on your keyboard. The command will execute immediately and the result will appear in the live log above.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Commands sent from the console run with **full operator (OP) privileges** — you don't need to be opped in-game to use them here.
</Info>

### Useful Minecraft Commands

Here are some commonly used commands you can run straight from the console:

```bash
# Player management
op PlayerName          # Give a player operator permissions
deop PlayerName        # Remove operator permissions
kick PlayerName        # Kick a player from the server
ban PlayerName         # Ban a player
pardon PlayerName      # Unban a player
whitelist add PlayerName   # Add player to whitelist
whitelist remove PlayerName

# Server management
save-all               # Force save all chunks to disk
stop                   # Gracefully stop the server
reload                 # Reload server configuration (use with caution)

# World & gameplay
time set day           # Set in-game time to day
weather clear          # Clear the weather
difficulty peaceful    # Change difficulty (peaceful/easy/normal/hard)
gamemode survival PlayerName  # Change a player's gamemode

# Messaging
say <message>          # Broadcast a message to all online players
tell PlayerName <msg>  # Send a private message to a player
```

<Warning>
  Be careful with commands like `stop` and `reload` — stopping the server from the console without warning can disrupt players. Always announce planned restarts in advance using the `say` command.
</Warning>

## Performance Stats

On the right-hand side of the console, you'll find a set of live performance statistics that update in real time. These give you an at-a-glance view of your server's health.

### Stats Explained

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="address-book" iconType="solid" title="Address">
    Your server's connection address (e.g. `sg.corehost.store:20094`). Share this with your players so they can connect. The port is unique to your server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="up" iconType="solid" title="Uptime">
    How long your server has been running since it was last started. For example, `2d 3h 30m` means the server has been online for 2 days, 3 hours, and 30 minutes. A low uptime may indicate a recent restart or crash.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="microchip" iconType="solid" title="CPU Load">
    Shows your server's current CPU usage as a percentage of the total available CPU allocated to your plan (e.g. `8.05% / 200%`). If this is consistently near or above 100%, your server may be under heavy load — consider optimising plugins or upgrading your plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="memory" iconType="solid" title="Memory (RAM)">
    Displays how much RAM your server is currently using vs. the total allocated (e.g. `5.7 GiB / 14 GiB`). If usage is consistently near the limit, you may experience lag or crashes. Consider increasing your plan or reducing memory-intensive plugins.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="floppy-disk" iconType="solid" title="Disk">
    Shows your total disk usage (e.g. `19.92 GiB / 39.06 GiB`). This includes your world files, plugins, backups, and logs. Monitor this regularly — running out of disk space can cause your server to stop saving chunks or crash.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="network-wired" iconType="solid" title="Network (Inbound / Outbound)">
    Tracks total data transferred to and from your server since last startup. High outbound traffic is normal for busy servers with many connected players. Unusually high values may indicate bots or a DDoS attempt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen icon="user" iconType="solid" title="Players Online">
    Shows the number of currently connected players. If this shows **Not Available**, your server may be starting up, offline, or the query port may not be configured.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Charts

At the bottom of the console page, three live graphs give you a visual history of your server's resource usage over time.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card icon="microchip" iconType="solid" title="CPU Load">
    Tracks CPU usage over time. Spikes are normal during world generation or large explosions. Sustained high usage suggests the server is under strain.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="memory" iconType="solid" title="Memory">
    Shows RAM consumption over time. A steady climb that never drops may indicate a memory leak in a plugin.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="wifi" iconType="solid" title="Network">
    Displays inbound and outbound traffic. Useful for spotting unusual activity or diagnosing connectivity issues.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Keep an eye on your memory graph over time. If it climbs steadily without dropping after player sessions end, a plugin may have a memory leak — try disabling plugins one at a time to identify the culprit.
</Tip>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="Why is my console not showing any output?">
    If the console appears blank or frozen, try refreshing the page. If the server is offline, no logs will appear until it's started. Check the power buttons to confirm the server status.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="My CPU usage is at 100% — what should I do?">
    High CPU is often caused by too many plugins, a large number of players, or a runaway process. Try restarting the server, removing resource-heavy plugins, or reducing view distance in your server config. If it persists, consider upgrading your plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="My server says 'Players Online: Not Available' — why?">
    This usually means the server is still starting up, or the query port isn't configured. Wait a minute after startup and refresh the page. If it still shows unavailable, check if the configured IP is correct in the More\>Players section.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="Can I run commands while the server is offline?">
    No — commands require an active server process to execute. Start your server first, then send commands once it's fully booted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="How do I find my server's IP address to share with friends?">
    Your connection address is shown in the **Address** field on the right-hand stats panel (e.g. `sg.corehost.store:20094`). Share this with your players exactly as shown.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
