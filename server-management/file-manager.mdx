## Navigating the File Manager

When you open the File Manager, you'll land in your server's root directory — shown in the breadcrumb path at the top of the page (e.g. `home / container /`).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse directories">
    Click any **folder** to open it and view its contents. The breadcrumb trail at the top updates as you navigate deeper into the file tree.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go back up">
    Click any part of the **breadcrumb path** at the top to jump back to a parent directory instantly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select files or folders">
    Use the **checkbox** on the left of any item to select it. You can select multiple items at once for bulk actions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The file list shows the name, size, and last modified date for every item. Folders always appear at the top, followed by files.

## Understanding Your Server's File Structure

Here's a breakdown of the key folders you'll find in a typical Minecraft server directory:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="box-archive" title="cache">
    Temporary cached data generated by the server. You generally don't need to touch this — it's rebuilt automatically as needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="sliders" title="config">
    Contains configuration files for the server and its plugins. This is one of the most important folders — most customisation happens here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="book" title="libraries">
    Core server libraries required to run the server software. Do **not** modify or delete files here unless directed by support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="scroll" title="logs">
    Stores all server log files, including crash reports and historical activity. Useful for diagnosing issues after the fact.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="puzzle-piece" title="plugins">
    Contains all installed plugins (`.jar` files) and their individual config folders. Install or remove plugins by adding/deleting files here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="versions">
    Holds server version files. Managed automatically — avoid modifying unless you know what you're doing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="earth-americas" title="world / world_nether / world_the_end">
    Your server's world data. These folders contain all chunk, player, and region data for each dimension. Back these up regularly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
<Info>
  The file structure above is based on a **PaperMC** server. Your directory layout may differ depending on the server software you're running (e.g. Vanilla, Fabric, Forge, Spigot, Purpur).
  </Info>

## Toolbar Actions

At the top right of the File Manager, you'll find four action buttons available at all times:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card icon="trash-can" iconType="solid" title="Trash Bin">
    View and restore recently deleted files. Items in the trash can be permanently deleted or recovered from here.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="folder-plus" iconType="solid" title="Create Directory">
    Create a new folder in the current directory. You'll be prompted to enter a name before it's created.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="upload" iconType="solid" title="Upload">
    Upload files from your computer directly into the current directory. Supports drag-and-drop or file picker selection.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="file-circle-plus" iconType="solid" title="New File">
    Create a blank file in the current directory. You can name it and edit its contents immediately in the built-in editor.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## File & Folder Actions

Every file and folder has a **`··· menu`** on the right side of its row. Clicking it reveals a set of actions you can perform on that item:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen" title="Rename">
    Give the file or folder a new name. The item stays in its current location — only the name changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrows-up-down-left-right" title="Move">
    Move the file or folder to a different location within your server's file system. You'll be prompted to enter the destination path.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Permissions">
    View and change the file's Unix permissions (read, write, execute) for owner, group, and others. Most files should be left at their defaults unless you have a specific reason to change them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Duplicate">
    Create an exact copy of the file or folder in the same directory. Useful for backing up a config before editing it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="box-open" title="Unarchive">
    Extract the contents of a compressed archive (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`, etc.) directly into the current directory. No need to download and extract locally.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Download">
    Download the file directly to your computer. Useful for backing up world files, configs, or any other important data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="trash" title="Delete">
    Permanently delete the file or folder. Deleted items are moved to the **Trash Bin** and can be recovered from there if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Before editing any config file, use **Duplicate** to create a backup copy. That way, if something goes wrong, you can restore the original in seconds.
</Tip>

## Editing Files

The File Manager includes a built-in text editor — no external tools needed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a file">
    Click the name of any text-based file (e.g. `server.properties`, `bukkit.yml`, `config.yml`) to open it in the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit the file contents directly in the editor. Syntax highlighting is supported for common formats like YAML, JSON, and plain text.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Click **Save** when you're done. Your changes take effect immediately on disk.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart if required">
    Most config changes require a server restart to take effect. Head to the **Console** page and use the restart button after saving.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Some files — like `eula.txt` and `server.properties` — are critical to your server's operation. Edit them carefully and always restart after making changes.
</Warning>

## Uploading Files

You can upload files from your computer directly into your server through the File Manager.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the target directory">
    Browse to the folder where you want to upload (e.g. navigate into `plugins/` before uploading a plugin `.jar`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Upload">
    Click the **Upload** button in the top-right toolbar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your files">
    Choose files using the file picker, or drag and drop them directly onto the upload area. Multiple files can be uploaded at once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the upload to complete">
    A progress indicator will show the upload status. Do not navigate away until all files have finished uploading.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Large files (like world backups or `.zip` archives) may take a few minutes to upload depending on your connection speed. Once uploaded, use the **Unarchive** action to extract compressed files directly on the server.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Files larger than 100 MB cannot be uploaded through the File Manager.** For large files, you'll need to use **SFTP** instead. SFTP allows you to transfer files of any size directly to your server using an FTP client like FileZilla or WinSCP.

  Your SFTP credentials can be found in the [Settings](/docs/server-management/settings#sftp) page of your game panel.
</Warning>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I upload files larger than 100 MB?">
    No — the File Manager has a **100 MB upload limit**. For larger files (e.g. world saves, modpacks, large archives), you'll need to use **SFTP**. Your SFTP credentials and connection details are available on the [Settings](/docs/server-management/settings#sftp) page of your game panel.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I upload entire folders at once?">
    The file manager supports uploading multiple files at once, but not full folder structures. To upload a folder, compress it into a `.zip` first, upload the archive, then use **Unarchive** to extract it in place.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I accidentally deleted a file — can I recover it?">
    Yes. Click **Trash Bin** in the top-right toolbar. Deleted files are held there temporarily and can be restored with one click. If the trash has been emptied, you'll need to restore from a backup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I edit some files?">
    Binary files (like `.jar`, `.zip`, `.png`) cannot be opened in the text editor — they'll need to be downloaded, modified locally, and re-uploaded. Only text-based files can be edited in-browser.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I install a plugin?">
    Navigate into your `plugins/` folder, then click **Upload** and select the plugin's `.jar` file. Once uploaded, restart your server from the Console for the plugin to load.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does changing file permissions do?">
    Unix permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file. For most server files, the default permissions are correct. Only change them if you have a specific reason to — incorrect permissions can cause your server to fail to read its own files.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit server.properties from here?">
    Yes — click `server.properties` in the root directory to open it in the editor. After saving your changes, restart the server from the Console for them to take effect.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
