## Getting Started with Core Host

Before you can fully enjoy your server, you'll need to create accounts on two key systems:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Billing Site" icon="credit-card" iconType="solid">
    Manage your purchases, subscriptions, invoices, and support tickets. This is your hub for payments and service management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Game Panel" icon="server" iconType="solid">
    Control and configure your server (e.g., Minecraft). Start/stop servers, edit files, add sub-users, and monitor performance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Important:** The accounts on the billing site and game panel are **DIFFERENT** and must be created separately.
</Warning>

Creating an account on both panels ensures that you have full access. The billing panel handles your financial side, while the game panel gives you technical control over your servers.

## Create Account on Billing Site

Creating an account on the billing panel is essential for managing your hosting services, placing orders, and submitting support tickets.

### Step 1: Visit the Billing Panel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Your Information">
    - **Full Name**: Your first and last name
    - **Email Address**: A valid email you can access
    - **Password**: Create a strong, secure password
    - **Confirm Password**: Re-enter your password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept Terms of Service">

  </Step>
</Steps>

**[Image Placeholder: Registration Form with Fields Filled]**

<Tip>
  Use a strong password with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters for maximum security.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Verify Your Email Address

Email verification is crucial to activate your account and ensure secure access.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Email Inbox">
    Look for the verification email from **Core Host**. It should arrive within a few minutes after registration.

    If you don't see it in your inbox, **check your Spam or Junk folder**—it may have been filtered automatically.

    **[Image Placeholder: Verification Email Example]**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Verification Email">
    The email will have a subject line like:

    - "Verify Your Email Address"
    - "Complete Your Core Host Registration"

    Inside, you'll find a verification link or button to activate your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the Verification Link">
    Click the verification link in the email to confirm your email address. This will redirect you to the Core Host website and validate your account.

    After clicking the link, you'll see a success message confirming your email has been verified.

    **[Image Placeholder: Email Verified Success Screen]**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Verification emails typically arrive within 1-2 minutes.** If you haven't received it after 5 minutes, you can request a new verification email from the login page.
</Note>

---

### Step 4: Login to Your Billing Account

Now that your email is verified, you can access your account:

1. Return to the [Billing Panel](https://billing.corehost.store)
2. Enter your registered email and password
3. Click **"Login"** to access your dashboard

**[Image Placeholder: Billing Dashboard After Login]**

  **Success!** Your billing account is now ready. You can now purchase servers, manage subscriptions, and submit support tickets.

## Create Account on Game Panel

The game panel (powered by Pterodactyl) is where you'll manage your server's technical aspects—starting/stopping, file management, configurations, and more.

<Info>
  **Account Creation Requirements:**

  Your game panel account is **automatically created only after you purchase a server plan** with us. You cannot create a game panel account manually before making a purchase.
</Info>

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase a Server Plan">
    First, you need to order a game server through our billing panel. Your game panel account will be generated automatically during the provisioning process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Your Credentials">
    After your purchase is complete, you'll receive an email with:

    - Game panel login URL
    - Your username (usually your email)
    - Instructions to set your password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Your Game Panel">
    Follow the email instructions to access your game panel and begin managing your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **First Time Purchase?** If this is your first time ordering from Core Host, make sure you've completed the billing account creation process above before purchasing a server.
</Warning>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need two separate accounts?

The billing account manages your payments and subscriptions, while the game panel account gives you technical control over your servers. Separating these systems enhances security and allows for better access management.

---

### I didn't receive the verification email. What should I do?

First, check your spam/junk folder. If it's not there, wait 5 minutes and request a new verification email from the billing panel login page. Still having issues? Contact our support team.

---

### Can I create a game panel account before purchasing?

No, game panel accounts are automatically created when you purchase a server. This ensures your panel access is properly linked to your active services.

---

### I forgot my password. How do I reset it?

Click the "Forgot Password" link on either the billing panel or game panel login page. You'll receive a password reset email with instructions.

---

### Can I use the same password for both accounts?

While technically possible, we recommend using different passwords for enhanced security. Consider using a password manager to keep track of your credentials.
